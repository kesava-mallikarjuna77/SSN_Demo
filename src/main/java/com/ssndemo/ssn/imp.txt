Let's break it down step-by-step:

Overall Idea
You have two services:

Check-In Service: When a client checks in, this service sends a notification.

StreamMessages Service: This service streams these notifications to clients using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Technologies Used
Spring WebFlux: For handling asynchronous, non-blocking requests.

Reactor: For managing reactive streams of data.

Check-In Service
Dependencies: Add Spring Boot Starter WebFlux in your pom.xml.

Controller: A REST endpoint that clients call to check in and send notifications to the StreamMessages Service.
Explanation
Dependencies: Ensure your project includes Spring WebFlux and Reactor for reactive programming.

Check-In Service:

Defines a REST controller (CheckInController).

On check-in, it sends a message to the EventPublisherService.

EventPublisherService publishes this event using Sinks.Many.

StreamMessages Service:

Another REST controller (StreamMessagesController) that subscribes to the EventPublisherService.

Uses Flux<String> to stream events to clients with SSE.

How It Works
When a Client Checks In: The Check-In Service receives the message and publishes it through the EventPublisherService.

Streaming to Clients: Clients connected to the StreamMessages Service receive the streamed events in real-time via SSE.

This method allows you to handle real-time updates between services efficiently without requiring additional message brokers.
